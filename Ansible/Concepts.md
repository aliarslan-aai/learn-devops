# Introduction
If you're systems engineer you do a lot of repetetive tasks everyday with

* sizing & creating new hosts or VMs
* define configs on them
* patching hundreds of servers
* migrations
* deploying applications
* performing security & compliance audits
* provisioning
* configuration managment
* continuous delivery
* application deployment


Some people write scripts to do all this. But this requires coding skills and regular maintenance. A lot of time and energy to put these scripts together. This is where Ansible helps.

Ansible uses playbooks for IT automation.

playbooks are written in yaml
