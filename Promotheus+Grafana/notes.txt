Prometheus =  storage backend
Grafana = analysis and visualization

* Prometheus collects metrics from monitored targets by
scraping metrics from HTTP endpoints on these targets

e.g: memory used, storage consumed, status of a service

* Grafana acts as a visualization layer only

We'll use Dockerized deployment of prometheus and grafana
from https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockprom
* it sets up cAdvisor, grafana, and Promotheus with NodeExporter and AlertManager

The default configuration used in this image already defines Prometheus as a job,
with a scraping interval of 15 seconds, so the server is set to monitor itself.

- job_name: 'prometheus'
   scrape_interval: 10s
   static_configs:
     - targets: ['localhost:9090']

To install this stack, use these commands:
    git clone https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockprom
    cd dockprom
    docker-compose up -d
