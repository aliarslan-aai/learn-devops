RPM vs YUM
-----------
RedHat Package manager
.rpm file extension
5 ops:
1. install     rpm -ivh telnet.rpm
2. uninstall   rpm -e telnet.rpm
3. upgrade     rpm -Uvh telnet.rpm
4. query       rpm -q telnet.rpm
5. verifying   rpm -Vf <path_to_file>

* RPM does not resolve package dependencies on its own, so we need YUM
* YUM uses RPM under the hood

yum stores repo info at /etc/yum.repos.d/*.repo

yum install -y httpd
yum repolist - displays all repos added to the system
yum provides scp - check which repo provides scp
yum remove httpd
yum update telnet - updates a single package
yum update - updates all packages

DPKG vs APT
-------------
DPKG Debian package manager
5 ops:
1. install/upgrade     dpkg -i telnet.rpm
2. uninstall           dpkg -r telnet.rpm
3. list                dpkg -l telnet.rpm
4. status              dpkg -s telnet.rpm
5. verifying           dpkg -p <path_to_file>

* DPKG does not resolve package dependencies on its own, so we need APT
* APT uses DPKG under the hood

DPKG stores sources info at /etc/apt/sources.list

apt update - refresh all repos
apt upgarde - upgrades exisint packages
apt edit-sources - opens /etc/apt/sources.list in editor
apt install telnet
apt remove telnet
apt search telnet
apt list | grep telnet

APT vs APT-GET
----------------
APT is more user friendly
APT has more user friendly output
APT can be used to search a package
we need apt-cache to search if we use apt-get
