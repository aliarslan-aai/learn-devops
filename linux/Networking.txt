DNS - Domain Name Server
--------------------------
hostnames are stored at /etc/hosts
    192.1.1.10 db

dns conf file - stored nameserver ip
/etc/resolv.conf
    nameserver 192.168.1.100
    nameserver 8.8.8.8
    search mycompany.com <- this helps to resolve "web" for web.mycompany.com
    search google.com <- this helps to resolve "maps" for maps.google.com

order to look for a hostname is defined in /etc/nsswitch.conf
...
hosts:  files dns
...
* here it is set to first look in /etc/hosts file then the DNS.

What Record Types are stored in DNS server?
1. A: web-server with ipv4 addresses
1. AAAA web-server with ipv6 addresses
1. CNAME: mapping one name to another name

ping to check if server is up
nslookup to query hostname from dns server

Switching & Routing
----------------------
ip link - list and modify interfaces on the host
ip addr - show ip addresses assigned to those interfaces
ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev eth0 - set ip address on the interface
route - displays existing routing table
ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1 - adds a route to connect to external an network
ip route add default via 192.168.1.1 - adds tfe default route to connect to any external network
sudo ip link set dev eth0 up - bring up an ethernet device

these changes are local - for persistence add them to /etc/networks/interfaces
